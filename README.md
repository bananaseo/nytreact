1. Time- I did not invest enough time on this assignment. Laptop's battery and charger was not working starting Friday. I barely got my laptop working on Monday evening. 
2. Used boilerplate from Activity 7
3. Ran yarn install for node modules
4. Mongoose- I still do not fully understand how to connect to mongoose db

To Do: 
5. (Back-end) API routes following Bamazon example- Make sure each route works
6. (Font-end) components- I am still shaky on using components- I need to review last Monday's vid
