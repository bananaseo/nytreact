1. Time- I did not invest enough time on this assignment. Laptop's battery and charger was not working starting Friday. I barely got my laptop working on Monday evening. 
2. Used boilerplate from Activity 7
3. Ran yarn install for node modules
4. Mongoose- I still do not fully understand how to connect to mongoose db
5. (Back-end) API routes following Pupster example- Make sure each route works
6. (Font-end) components- I am still shaky on using components



Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Deployment (Heroku)

To deploy, simply add and commit your changes, and push to Heroku. As is, the NPM scripts should take care of the rest.
